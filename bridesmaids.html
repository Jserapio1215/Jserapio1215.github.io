				<h3>Erica</h3>
				<h4>Maid of Honor</h4>
				<h4 id="clickme">BIO<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom" aria-hidden="true"></span>
				</h4>
				<p class="summary">Our memories together go all the way back to when we were five years old. My family and I had just moved to Washington from California and I hated the move and adjustment it created. I remember our doorbell ringing and the little neighbor girl, Erica, at our front door. She asked me if I wanted to come play Barbies with her and the rest was history. Erica has become my closest friend of 23 years and is my sister and family. Most of my life memories include you in them. From learning how to play T-ball together, making up songs about mashed potatoes, to being college roommates.  You are someone I can always count on until we are old and gray looking back at all of your lifelong memories. I could not be more excited to have you standing next to me on my wedding day and call you my maid of honor.</p>

				<h3>Caitlin</h3>
				<h4 id="clickme_2">BIO<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom" aria-hidden="true"></span></h4>
				<p class="summary_2">Caitlin and I met in Kindergarten and quickly became good friends throughout grammar and high school. We went to college together and were pretty much inseparable. We lived together for 3 years in college and shared the same major so we could go to more classes together and fight for parking spots together in the crowed CWU campus parking lots. I always knew with Caitlin that I had made a life long friend. You have become such an important part of my life and I view you as family. You are always there for support when needed and I value your friendship. I am so thankful and appreciative of the bond we have developed over the years that nothing can change. I am so excited to have you in our wedding for our special day.</p>

				<h3>Chiara</h3>
				<h4 id="clickme_3">BIO<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom" aria-hidden="true"></span></h4>
				<p class="summary_3">I can remember meeting Chiara in elementary school and hanging out with her for the first time in 5th grade at Camp Seymour. We shared a cabin together and I could tell right away that this girl had some major energy to her that I wanted to be a part of.  Chiara has helped me to learn to always better myself and be kind to others in need. She has a huge heart and a lot of love for her friends and family. Chiara has an incredible way of always seeing the positives in every situation and not taking advantage of the small things in life. She is someone that everyone wants to be around and spend time with laughing for hours. I have always valued our friendship and knowing that I can turn to you no matter what the situation may be. You are always there to lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on. I cannot even begin to explain how thankful I am for your constant loyalty and friendship. You are so much fun to be around and make every memory that much better. I am so happy that you will be a part of my wedding day.</p>

				<h3>Brittany</h3>
				<h4 id="clickme_4">BIO<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom" aria-hidden="true"></span></h4>
				<p class="summary_4">Brittany and I met in elementary school at Browns Point. We played soccer together and had the same 5th grade class when we really became close. We knew we would be friends forever when we watched Old Yeller in our 5th grade class and we were the only ones in tears when the dog died. I have so many fond memories with Brittany as kids and into adulthood. I have always known that Brittany is someone I can count on for anything and I can always be my weird self around her. Especially when we made those home videos together back in middle school! I have always felt a strong bond with you that has never changed no matter what colleges we went to or what situations we were in. Your friendship has always been so important to me and has seemed effortless. You are someone that I will call my best friend until we are old and gray watching those home videos together as kids. I am so thankful to have you as a bridesmaid for our wedding day.</p>

				<h3>Natalie</h3>
				<h4 id="clickme_5">BIO<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom" aria-hidden="true"></span></h4>
				<p class="summary_5">Natalie and I met for the first time in college. We started to become close during a girls spring break trip to Las Vegas. Unlike the saying, what happened in Vegas did not stay in Vegas. Our friendship continued to grow and build after the trip. After college we stayed in touch and she met her now husband through Jon and I. We all lived together in Green Lake and Natalie became more like family. I have always been so appreciative of your constant loyalty and commitment to those you love. I have so many wonderful memories with you and you have helped me get through many challenges that life has presented. I value your friendship so much and am so excited to continue to make new memories with you raising our families together. I cannot wait to have you as a part of our special day.</p>

Our friendship and bond has grown stronger over the years and we have always remained close. I am so excited to have you in our wedding.</p>
